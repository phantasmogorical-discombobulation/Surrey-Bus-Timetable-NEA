- National Public Transport Access Node (NaPTAN) to access data on bus stops
- findthatpostcode.uk to access data on postcodes
- OpenStreetMap via Kivy MapView library
- Python Kivy for user interface

Due to this being an assessed A Level project, marks were awarded for commenting on the code, hence the excessive comments in each code files.
